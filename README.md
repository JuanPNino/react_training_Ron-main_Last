RON Notes:

In the comming period, we will look on the way we can get data out of Filemaker and display it on the screen. If you know that, then you can also get data from any other API, and display that on the screen also.

On the Claris API topic, you can find details on how to set-it up and how the api works at:
https://help.claris.com/en/data-api-guide/

You need to understand folliwng topics to move to next learning moment.:

Difference between Array and Object.
What is an async function, and why do get undefined as return sometimes.
What is an arrow function. (https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_arrow_function.asp)
map function
useState is a React component which will allow you to store data, and when data is updates it will refresh the screen. lots of resources on the internet, so study it.

Homework: 
Clone Repository, do an nmp i, and look at the code.

Google on javascript map function.

Google on Arrow Function  JE6

What is REST Api (Get, post, Put, Delete)
() => {
    this is the code
}

Homework: 
Currently the database name is part of the BaseURL. Ensure you get the database + Layout from the higher level component, and inject it in the endpoint.
Host your own database, and connect and display on screen.

Oct_27:
Update: Have been normalising the code, where the FMApi logic is more geberic and can be called from all modules and have same response logic.
Homework:
Fix the cors issue on server, in the meantime work on the database on rons, server.
Read about React Hooks and State. ( setState )
Take a look at Material UI: https://material-ui.com/
Try to display the employee in the table from material UI
The product is currently not working, tell me why and what do you think is the best strategy to do it, do not have to code it, just the overal logic you think we should add?

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More
